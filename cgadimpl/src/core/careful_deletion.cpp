// Implements safe memory cleanup logic for autodiff nodes,
// respecting checkpointing, alias tracking, and gradient dependencies.
//
// The functions in this file are part of the `ag::memory` subsystem
// and are designed to help reclaim memory safely during or after
// forward/backward computations without breaking the computational graph.
//
// They ensure that tensors are only freed when they are no longer needed
// for gradient computation, recomputation, or alias/view consistency.

/*
 * =============================================================
 * Overview
 * =============================================================
 * 
 * The goal of this file is to manage **safe tensor deletion** for graph nodes
 * while maintaining correctness in automatic differentiation (autodiff).
 * 
 * In deep learning frameworks, each operation (node) holds:
 *     - a `value` tensor (its output),
 *     - a `grad` tensor (for accumulated gradient),
 *     - connections to its input nodes (parents).
 *
 * After a backward pass, many of these tensors are no longer needed.
 * However, we cannot simply free them immediately, because:
 *     - Some nodes are part of **checkpoints** (will be recomputed later).
 *     - Some tensors share memory with other tensors (aliases/views).
 *     - Some nodes’ gradients have not yet been fully propagated.
 *
 * To handle this safely, this file defines rules to determine when
 * a node’s data can be safely freed.
 *
 * The main functions are:
 *      `try_delete_node()` – checks and frees a single node safely.
 *      `sweep_safe_nodes()` – performs a global cleanup pass.
 *      `debug_deletion_state()` – prints the current deletion summary.

// Internal helper functions (not exposed to users)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
 *  has_active_alias():
 *  -------------------
 *  Checks whether the given node participates in an alias group.
 *  Inplace or view operations can cause multiple tensors to share
 *  the same underlying data storage (e.g., slicing, transpose, etc.).
 *
 *  If such aliasing exists, deleting one tensor may accidentally
 *  invalidate others, so deletion must be skipped.
 *
 *  Uses `inplace::detail::has_alias()` — an internal helper that
 *  tracks alias groups created by in-place operations.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      n : pointer to a Node in the computational graph
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      true  — if this node’s tensor storage is shared with others
 *      false — if the tensor has exclusive ownership

/*
 *  gradients_done():
 *  -----------------
 *  Checks whether all gradient dependencies for a node have been resolved.
 *  In autodiff, nodes accumulate gradients from their children.
 *  We must not delete a node until all its parents’ gradient computations
 *  are finished, or it could break the gradient chain.
 *
 *  This simple check iterates over the node’s input edges and ensures
 *  that no parent still requires gradient updates.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      n : pointer to a Node
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      true  — if no parent node still requires gradients
 *      false — if gradient propagation is still ongoing

/*
 *  try_delete_node():
 *  -------------------
 *  Safely attempts to free a single node’s tensor data (`value` and `grad`)
 *  based on several safety checks and a user-specified deletion policy.
 *
 *  This function performs a series of ordered checks to decide
 *  whether the node can be safely deleted:
 *
 *    1 Skip leaf nodes (`Op::Leaf`) — these are constants or parameters.
 *    2 Skip checkpointed nodes — their activations are needed for recomputation.
 *    3 Skip aliased tensors — shared buffers cannot be safely deleted.
 *    4 Skip nodes whose gradients are not yet fully propagated.
 *    5 If all checks pass → delete value and gradient tensors.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      node   : pointer to target Node to check and delete
 *      policy : deletion behavior
 *               - `AlwaysSafe` → only delete when 100% safe.
 *               - `Aggressive` → delete eagerly, even if risky.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      true  — if the node’s data was safely freed.
 *      false — if the node was skipped for safety.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *      - This is designed to be called repeatedly after backward().
 *      - Aggressive deletion optionally erases in-place metadata via
 *        `inplace::detail::erase_snapshot(node)` to free alias info too.
